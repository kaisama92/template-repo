## Description

_This application will set up a JavaScript dev environment utilizing the technologies listed above. This makes starting and working on a modular application easier._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository to your Desktop_
* _Install Node._
* _Type the command 'npm install' into your command line. This will install the technologies needed by the dev environment._
* _Use the command 'npm run build' to build your project._
* _Use the command 'npm run start' to build your project and start a live server._
* _Use the command 'npm run lint' to use ESLint on your project._
* _Use the command 'npm run test' to use Jest to test your logic. You will need to set up a `__tests__` directory in the top level of your project with files for each test suite you would like to run. These suites will utilize import and export statements to link the js files you would like to test._


## Known Bugs

* _In some cases, npm may not function properly. To fix this, you will need to install a node version manager to find a version of Node that works. I used version 16.14.0_
